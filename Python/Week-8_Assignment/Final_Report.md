## Research outcome
Research output increased dramatically in 2020, corresponding to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Continued steady growth in subsequent years as research diversified.

Most common terms in titles included “vaccine”, “pandemic”, “transmission”, and “clinical”, highlighting major research priorities.

## Reflection

# Challenges Faced:

- The metadata.csv file was very large (several GBs), which caused memory issues. I learned to use parameters like low_memory=False and selective column loading to handle large datasets.

- Many columns had missing data. Deciding which to drop, fill, or transform required careful consideration.

- Creating a Streamlit app required integrating multiple steps such as data loading, filtering, visualization, and UI design — into one seamless workflow.

# Key Learnings:

- Learned how to use Pandas for real-world data cleaning and transformation.

- Gained experience in data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.

- Improved my understanding of the data science pipeline, from raw data to actionable insights.
